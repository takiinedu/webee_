        <p class="inner_content">In recent years, there has been a concerning rise in shark attacks in coastal waters
            around the world. As human activity in these areas continues to increase, so does the interaction between
            people and sharks. However, advancements in technology, specifically drones and artificial intelligence
            (AI), are offering promising solutions to safeguard against these incidents and protect beachgoers.</p>
        <p class="inner_content">One of the key advantages of drones is their ability to provide an aerial perspective
            of the coastal waters. Equipped with high-resolution cameras and real-time video streaming capabilities,
            drones can quickly and efficiently survey large stretches of coastline, identifying potential shark
            activity. This enables authorities to promptly alert beach authorities and visitors, allowing them to take
            necessary precautions or evacuate the area if needed.</p>
        <p class="inner_content">But it doesn't stop there. AI plays a crucial role in analyzing the vast amount of data
            collected by drones. By employing machine learning algorithms, AI systems can detect patterns and behaviors
            indicative of sharks. These algorithms can distinguish between different marine species, including sharks,
            based on their size, shape, and movement patterns. This automated analysis significantly reduces the time
            and effort required for human operators to manually review the drone footage, ensuring a more efficient and
            accurate identification process.</p>
        <p class="inner_content">In addition to real-time monitoring, drones equipped with AI can also act as early
            warning systems. By continuously monitoring the behavior of sharks in coastal waters, AI algorithms can
            predict the likelihood of an attack occurring. This proactive approach allows authorities to implement
            preventive measures such as deploying shark nets, increasing lifeguard presence, or even temporarily closing
            beaches during periods of heightened risk.</p>
